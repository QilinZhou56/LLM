# Learning Tour in Large Language Models (LLM)

Welcome to the repository that serves as a self-paced learning tour for enthusiasts and practitioners in the field of Large Language Models (LLM). This material is inspired by the "Foundations of Local Large Language Models" course offered on Coursera and augmented with insightful tutorials found on Medium.

## My Personal Journey

As a learner and practitioner deeply engaged with the LLM landscape, I've documented my journey through:

- **Reflective Notes**: Personal insights and reflections that capture my learning experiences and evolving understanding.
  - Chapter 1 (Intro to LLM)
    - Mitigating risks of LLMs
      - Retrieval Augmentation: combining search and retrieval with an LLM to improve results, with external knowledge sources.
- **Mini-Projects**: Hands-on projects that showcase real-world applications and experimentation with LLMs.

## Understanding LLMs

The field of LLMs is novel and rapidly evolving. It is imperative for application developers, researchers, and users alike to grasp the fundamental workings of these models. Equally important is an awareness of the risks and ethical considerations that accompany the deployment of such powerful tools.

I believe that a comprehensive understanding of LLMs, combined with thoughtful consideration of their impact, is crucial for responsible innovation and application.
